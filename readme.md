# Wcat clone
We will build a global cli utility that will support following commands
- node wcat.js filepath => displays content of the file in the terminal 
- node wcat.js filepath1 filepath2 filepath3... => displays content of all files in the terminal(contactinated form) in the given order.
- node wcat.js -s filepath => convert big line breaks into a singular line break
- node wcat -n filepath => give numbering to all the lines 
- node wcat -b filepath => give numbering to non-empty lines
